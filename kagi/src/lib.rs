//! A client and parser for Kagi Search.
//!
//! This crate provides an asynchronous [`Client`] for querying [Kagi](https://kagi.com) with a
//! session token and parsing the streamed responses into [`SearchResult`]s and [`ImageResult`]s.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **`default-tls`** *(enabled by default)*: selects the default TLS backend (**`rustls`**).
//!   Disable default features and choose a TLS backend explicitly with **`rustls`**,
//!   **`native-tls`** or **`native-tls-vendored`**.
//! - **`gzip`**, **`brotli`**, **`deflate`**, **`zstd`** *(all enabled by default)*:
//!   decompression of compressed responses.
//!
//! ## Quick Start
//!
//! To get started, add this crate to your `Cargo.toml`. The main entry points for searching are
//! the [`Client::search`] and [`Client::images`] methods.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use kagi::{Client, Error};
//!
//! # async fn example() -> Result<(), Error> {
//! // Create a new client with a Kagi session token.
//! let client = Client::with_token("kagi session token");
//!
//! // Search for the given query.
//! let results = client.search("rust programming language").await?;
//!
//! if let Some(result) = results.first() {
//!     println!("{} - {}", result.title, result.url);
//! }
//!
//! // Or search for images.
//! let images = client.images("ferrous wheel").await?;
//!
//! if let Some(image) = images.first() {
//!     println!("{} ({}x{}) {}", image.title, image.width, image.height, image.image_url);
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```

// Allow repetition of structure name instead of replacing with self as the output from
// rust-analyzer becomes more readable
